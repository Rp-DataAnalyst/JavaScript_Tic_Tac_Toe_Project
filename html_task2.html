<h1> <u> Introduction to Python Language </u> </h1>
<h2> <u> What is Language? </u> </h2>
<h2> <u> What is a Programming Language? </u> </h2>
<p> 1. A <b>Programming Language </b> is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a
computer. <br>
2. Enables developers to write programs for various tasks such as web development, data 
analysis, and automation. <br>
3. <b>Examples</b>: C, Java, Python, JavaScript. </p>
<h2> Why Python? </h2>
<p> 1. <b> Ease of Use: </b> Simple syntax, ideal for beginners. <br>
2. <b>Versatility:</b> Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural,
functional). <br>
3. <b> Extensive Libraries:</b> Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web
development. <br>
4. <b> Community Support:</b> Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning. <br>
5. <b>Interpreted Language:</b> Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier. <br>
6. <b>Cross-Platform:</b> Python programs can run on various platforms without modification
(Windows, macOS, Linux). <br>
7. <b>Scalability:</b> While often seen as a scripting language, Python scales well for larger applications
when combined with appropriate frameworks or tools (e.g., Django). </p>
<h2> What is Python? </h2>
<p>1. <b>Python</b> is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and <br>
readability. It was created by <b>Guido van Rossum</b> in the late 1980s and first released in <b>1991</b>.<br>
Python emphasizes <b>code readability</b> and supports multiple programming paradigms, including <br>
<b>object-oriented, procedural</b>, and <b>functional programming.</b>
   a. Monty Python’s Flying Circus
   2. Older than Java (1995). </p>
<h2>Where Python is Used? </h2>
<p>1. <b>Web Development:</b> Frameworks: Django, Flask. <br>
2. <b>Data Science and Machine Learning:</b> Predictive modeling and data analysis using NumPy,
Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.  <br>
3. <b>Automation (Scripting):</b> Automating repetitive tasks.  <br>
4. <b>Game Development:</b> Framework: PyGame.  <br>
5. <b>Scientific Computing:</b> Libraries: SciPy, Matplotlib.  <br>
6. <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning:</b> Libraries: Keras, PyTorch.  <br>
7. <b>Web Scraping</b>: Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.  <br>
8. <b>Cybersecurity:</b> Used for creating tools to test system vulnerabilities. </p>
<p> <b> Companies using Python: </b> Google, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, NASA, Uber, Reddit, IBM, <br> 10000 Coders Dashboard.</p
<h1> <b> Some disadvantages of Python:</b> </h1>
<p>1. Slower Execution Speed <br>
○ Interpreted language, making it slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java. <br>
○ Not ideal for performance-critical applications (e.g., real-time systems, gaming 
engines). <br>
2. Memory Consumption <br>
○ Python’s dynamic typing and garbage collection can lead to higher memory usage. <br>
○ Not suitable for applications where memory optimization is crucial. <br>
3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) <br>
○ The GIL restricts the execution of multiple threads at the same time. <br>
○ This makes Python less efficient for multithreaded applications, especially on multi-core
processors. <br>
4. Runtime Errors <br>
○ Python’s dynamic nature allows runtime errors to occur if code is not thoroughly tested. <br>
○ This can lead to bugs in production if not handled properly. <br>
5. Limited Support for Low-Level Programming <br>
○ Languages like C or Rust are better suited for such tasks. </p>
